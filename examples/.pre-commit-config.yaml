# Example pre-commit configuration for Helm validation hooks
# Copy this file to your repository root as .pre-commit-config.yaml

# Option 1: Comprehensive validation (Recommended)
# Use a single hook that validates everything
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/ngamber/pre-commit
    rev: main  # or use a specific version tag like v1.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: helm-template-all

# Option 2: Granular validation
# Use separate hooks for different validation types
# Provides better control and faster execution
# repos:
#   - repo: https://github.com/ngamber/pre-commit
#     rev: main
#     hooks:
#       - id: helm-validate-custom-charts
#       - id: helm-validate-values-only
#       - id: helm-validate-appsets

# Option 3: Custom mix
# Pick and choose which validations you need
# repos:
#   - repo: https://github.com/ngamber/pre-commit
#     rev: main
#     hooks:
#       - id: helm-validate-custom-charts  # Always validate custom charts
#       - id: helm-validate-appsets        # Always validate ApplicationSets
#       # Skip values-only validation if not needed

# Option 4: Legacy hook (backward compatibility)
# repos:
#   - repo: https://github.com/ngamber/pre-commit
#     rev: main
#     hooks:
#       - id: helm-template-validate  # Same as helm-template-all
